    "The covariance matrix includes the covariance between all pairs of the selected variables (both continuous and encoded categorical variables).\n",
    "Interpreting Results:\n",
    "The covariance between continuous and encoded categorical variables needs careful interpretation. High or low covariance might suggest a potential relationship, but it does not imply causation or linearity.\n",
    "Since categorical variables were arbitrarily encoded, the covariance values should be considered as a preliminary step. Further analysis (like ANOVA, regression, or correlation analysis) might be more appropriate for understanding the relationships."
